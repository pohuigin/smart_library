#Active Region Detection Parameters (some from higgins et al. 2011)
#Some are new for HMI and not discussed in the paper... to be published...
#
#This version is specifically for generating simple SMART2 AR detections 
#for HMI rebinned to 1kx1k
#(not producing mag properties, core detections, etc)
#
#The detection parameters smooththresh & magthresh are determined by 
#running PLOT_HMI_CROSSCAL_RESID.PRO to determine the optimal values 
#to match the MDI detections 201004-201008 using the MDI parameter

hmi_rsun; 945.87290; F; radius of Sun in arcsecs 
#
#Switches
doproject; 0; I; do the detection and area calculation in a projected equal shape or area space (projects and then unprojects)
docosmicray; 1; I; do cosmic ray detection and fill in with NaN
domedianfilt; 0; I; process the magnetogram using median smoothing to help with noise (seems to cause noise detections at the limb!)
#
#Magnetogram Processing
cosmicthresh; 5000.; F; A hard threshold for detecting cosmic rays
medfiltwidth; 3.; F; the width of a box to use to perform median filter on magnetogram
#
#Projection Parameters
threshlon; 90.; F; the deg. to LOS to go out to for the projection
projscl; 1.5; F; the fractional increase/decrease in image size for the projected image
#
#HMI SMART detection based on pixel size determined from map structure and supergranule physical size
#smooth and mag thresholds determined by minimising the difference in overlap between HMI and MDI detections
smoothphys; 16.; F; Physical gaussian smoothing HWHM in Mm. The radius of a characteristic supergranule 
smooththresh; 15.0; F; a segmentation threshold used in processing magnetograms (for 1kx1k gaussian smoothed; determined from plot_hmi_crosscal_resid.pro by comparing HMI and MDI detection masks)
magthresh; 350.0; F; a secondary segmentation threshold (for MDI) used to find all flux fragments in an image
#
#HMI Core detection: use PSLs and strong field to detect the flaring cores of ARs
strongthresh; 230.0; F; a segmentation threshold to detect strong field fragments which are then dilated to form the 'cores' of ARs.
polethresh; .8; F; imbalanced fraction of total area covered by a given (+ or -) polarity (=abs(npos-nneg)/abs(npos+nneg)), below which, the detection will be considered multipolar (core passes the flux balance test)
#
#YAFTA Tracking Parameters for SMART detections in MDI data
#Everything is set to ridiculously low thresholds because I want everything that SMART detects to be tracked
yaftathresh; 1.; F; ignore pixels below this value [G]
yaftapeakthresh; 1.; F; not sure what this is used for...
yaftaminsize; 1; I; only track features w/min_size pixels [Npx]
yaftadx; 3.58E7; F; HMI Full Disk pixel size [cm]
yaftaminflux; 1.; F; if it has less flux, it ain't an AR! [Mx]
yaftabipolethresh; 0.; F; need at least *some* minority flux [fraction]
tlastfoundthresh;43200.0;F; The maximum time that can elapse with no detections being found before the tracking resets. (Allows for a couple bad datas with no detections, so as not to reset the tracking all the time.)
#
#AR magnetic property calculation parameters
r_kernsz; 10; I; the FWHM of the smoothing kernal for calculating Schrijver R value
psl_grad; 250.; F; a gradient threshold for determining the location of strong-gradient PSL
